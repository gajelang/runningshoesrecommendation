If a lighter shoe is what you're after, we suggest the Hoka Speedgoat 6 —a lighter alternative with a superior Vibram outsole for exceptional traction.|In our experience, the FF Blast midsole of the Trabuco 12 lacks the springiness many runners crave. For those valuing responsive energy return, we recommend the Nike Zegama 2 , which features the bouncy ZoomX foam found in top-tier racing shoes, delivering a more energized ride.",184.66

It's clear for us that this shoe isn't the best choice for short races, and we're hesitant to recommend it even for half or full marathons. Instead, we suggest the Nike Vaporfly 3 or the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 .|For a thrilling and unique running experience, we believe models like the Hoka Cielo X1 and Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 2 offer a similar ride with much less bulk.|Moreover, the steep price tag of the Prime X 2 Strung may deter many runners.
